## Project Overview

### Vision
Create a revolutionary learning experience where two AI agents (Questioner and Buddy) engage in Socratic dialogue, with the user guiding the conversation through choices. The user learns by teaching the Buddy agent through guided discovery.

### Core Concept
- **Questioner Agent**: Asks Socratic questions to guide discovery
- **Buddy Agent**: Thinks out loud, makes mistakes, learns alongside user
- **User Role**: Guides Buddy by selecting options (not typing answers)
- **Learning Goal**: User discovers concepts by teaching, not by being taught

### Success Metrics
- [ ] User engagement time (target: 15+ min per session)
- [ ] Completion rate (target: 70%+)
- [ ] User-reported comprehension improvement
- [ ] Return rate for additional topics
- [ ] Agent conversation coherence score

### Data Flow

1. User starts conversation with topic
2. System initializes both agents with context
3. Questioner asks first question
4. Buddy responds with thinking process
5. System generates user options based on Buddy's response
6. User selects an option (guides the conversation)
7. System interprets choice and generates next turn
8. Repeat 3-7 until learning goal achieved
9. System provides summary and reflection

### 2.2 Build Questioner Agent

**Priority:** CRITICAL - First agent in the conversation

#### Prompt Engineering

```python
QUESTIONER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a Socratic teacher named "Q" who guides students through discovery learning.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. Never give direct answers - always ask questions
2. Build on the Buddy's thinking, not the user's
3. Use concrete, relatable examples
4. Adjust difficulty based on Buddy's responses
5. Guide toward insight, not just correctness

CONVERSATION FLOW:
- You ask questions to the Buddy (the learning companion)
- The user guides the Buddy by selecting options
- Your questions should help Buddy discover concepts naturally

DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
- Beginner: Use everyday analogies, simple concepts
- Intermediate: Introduce technical terms, ask for connections
- Advanced: Challenge assumptions, explore edge cases

QUESTION TYPES:
1. Observational: "What do you notice about X?"
2. Comparative: "How is X similar to Y?"
3. Causal: "What might cause X to happen?"
4. Hypothetical: "What if we changed X?"
5. Reflective: "Why do you think that might be?"

CURRENT CONTEXT:
Topic: {topic}
Learning Goal: {learning_goal}
Buddy's Last Response: {buddy_last_response}
User's Guidance: {user_choice}
Concepts Covered: {concepts_covered}
Current Difficulty: {difficulty}

YOUR TASK:
Generate the next Socratic question that:
1. Builds on Buddy's current thinking
2. Moves closer to the learning goal
3. Matches the current difficulty level
4. Encourages discovery, not memorization

Respond in JSON format:
{{
  "question": "Your Socratic question here",
  "reasoning": "Why this question advances learning",
  "expected_buddy_thinking": ["possible thought 1", "possible thought 2"],
  "difficulty_adjustment": "easier/same/harder",

4. Current Answer: State your best attempt
5. Confidence: Express how sure you are

USER GUIDANCE:
The student (user) helps guide your thinking by choosing options like:
- "You're on the right track" → Continue this line of thinking
- "Try a different angle" → Pivot your approach
- "Need a hint" → Ask Q for help
- "Explain more" → Elaborate on your current thought

CURRENT CONTEXT:
Topic: {topic}
Question from Q: {questioner_question}
Your Previous Thinking: {buddy_context}
User's Last Guidance: {user_choice}
What You Know So Far: {buddy_knowledge}

## Technical Specifications

### LLM Configuration

```python
# Recommended settings for conversation agents

QUESTIONER_CONFIG = {
    "model": "gpt-4",  # or claude-3-5-sonnet for better reasoning
    "temperature": 0.7,  # Balanced creativity
    "max_tokens": 500,  # Keep questions concise
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "frequency_penalty": 0.3,  # Reduce repetitive questions
    "presence_penalty": 0.2,
}

BUDDY_CONFIG = {
    "model": "gpt-4",  # or gpt-3.5-turbo for cost savings
    "temperature": 0.8,  # More creative thinking
    "max_tokens": 800,  # Allow longer thinking process
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "frequency_penalty": 0.5,  # More varied thinking
    "presence_penalty": 0.3,
}

# Cost estimation (OpenAI GPT-4)
# ~$0.03 per 1K input tokens
# ~$0.06 per 1K output tokens
# Average conversation: ~30 turns × 1000 tokens = $1.80/conversation
```

### Context Window Management

```python
# Strategy for managing conversation context

MAX_CONTEXT_MESSAGES = 20  # Last 20 messages
MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS = 4000  # Approximately 3000 words

def build_agent_context(conversation: Conversation) -> str:
    """
    Build context for agent, prioritizing:
    1. Learning goal (always included)
    2. Last 5 turns (recent context)
    3. Key insights discovered (summarized)
    4. Current misconceptions (if any)
    5. Earlier turns (summarized, not full text)
    """
    pass
```

### Caching Strategy

```python
# Redis caching for performance

CACHE_KEYS = {
    "active_conversation": "conv:{conversation_id}:state",  # 30 min TTL
    "agent_context": "conv:{conversation_id}:agent:{role}",  # 30 min TTL
    "user_options": "conv:{conversation_id}:options",  # 5 min TTL
    "recent_messages": "conv:{conversation_id}:messages",  # 15 min TTL
}

# Cache invalidation triggers:
# - User makes a choice → Invalidate options
# - New turn starts → Invalidate agent context
# - Conversation ends → Clear all conversation caches
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```python
# Key areas to test

1. Agent Generation
   - Test: Questioner generates appropriate questions
   - Test: Buddy generates realistic thinking
   - Test: Difficulty adjustment works
   - Test: Context is used correctly

2. Turn Management
   - Test: Turns alternate correctly
   - Test: State transitions are valid
   - Test: Error states are handled

3. Option Generation
   - Test: Options are contextually relevant
   - Test: Options cover different strategies
   - Test: Options are user-friendly

4. Context Management
   - Test: Context window stays within limits
   - Test: Important information is preserved
   - Test: Summarization works correctly
```

### Integration Tests

```python
# End-to-end conversation flows

1. Happy Path
   - Start conversation
   - Complete 10+ turns
   - End conversation
   - Verify summary generated

2. Error Scenarios
   - LLM timeout
   - Invalid user choice
   - Conversation abandonment
   - Agent context too large

3. Edge Cases
   - Very short conversations (1-2 turns)
   - Very long conversations (50+ turns)
   - Rapid user interactions
   - Concurrent conversations
```

### User Acceptance Testing

```python
# Manual testing checklist

□ Conversation feels natural and engaging
□ Agents don't repeat themselves excessively
□ Questions are appropriately challenging
□ Buddy's thinking feels authentic
□ Options are clear and actionable
□ Progress is visible
□ Summary is helpful and accurate
□ Can resume conversation after break
□ Mobile experience is good
□ Accessibility works (keyboard, screen reader)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Decide on Implementation Order**
   - Option A: Complete existing models first (safe approach)
   - Option B: Build conversation system first (new feature focus)
   - Option C: Build MVP of dual-agent with hardcoded topics

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Ensure all dependencies installed
   - Configure LLM API keys
   - Test database connection
   - Verify Redis is running

3. **Create First Prototype**
   - Choose one simple topic (e.g., "How does a battery work?")
   - Hardcode conversation flow
   - Test basic agent interaction
   - Validate concept with users

### Questions to Resolve

- [ ] Which LLM provider to use primarily? (OpenAI vs Anthropic)
- [ ] What's the budget for LLM API costs?
- [ ] Do we want real-time updates (WebSocket) or polling?
- [ ] Should conversations be resumable after days/weeks?
- [ ] What's the target age group / education level?
- [ ] Do we want multi-language support from the start?
